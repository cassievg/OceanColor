**API Documentation (Swagger)**
We use Swagger (OpenAPI 3.0) to document and test all API endpoints.
### ðŸ”— How to Access
* Open Swagger Editor  
* Import the `swagger.json` file located in the root of this repository  
* Interact with the API using the interface

## **Project Structure**

/frontend          â†’ React front-end  
/backend          â†’ Node.js backend  
/models          â†’ MongoDB models (User, Ticket, Reply)  
/routes          â†’ API route handlers  
/Context         â†’ React AuthContext for auth logic

## **Deployment**

* The system is containerized with Docker  
* CI/CD pipeline ensures automatic deployment on push  
* Sessions and environment variables are securely managed on the server  
* Hosted using cloudflared

## **Lessons Learned**

* Gained experience with advanced MongoDB modeling, including subdocuments and normalization  
* Built a modular React front-end and integrated it with a RESTful Express API  
* Implemented secure, session-based authentication and authorization  
* Learned to configure and troubleshoot Docker and CI/CD pipelines  
* Used Swagger for live API documentation and real-time endpoint testing
